A should ask B to route to AS-paths: A-W and A-V.  

A should ask C to route to AS-path: A-V.

C should receive AS-paths: B-A-W, B-A-V, A-V.

If the AS-PATH attribute of a route received by a router contains its own AS, the route will generate a loop.   

The AS path lists all AS numbers passed along the path.
