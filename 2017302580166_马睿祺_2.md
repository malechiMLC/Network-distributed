## Chapter 1

### P2.
The end-to-end delay for sending a packet of length L via an N links with transmission rate R is N*(L/R).

So, if we send packets one after the other across N links, after each L/R, another packet will arrive.

Thus, to send P packets one after the other across N links, the end-to-end delay is **N*(L/R) + (P-1)*(L/R) = (N+P-1)*L/R**.


### P7.
**totalTime = (56*8)bits / 64kbps + (56*8)bits / 2Mbps + 10ms = 17.224ms**

Thus, it will take around 17.224ms.


### P12.
while transmitting one packet, we need: 

time_one = (1500*8)bits / 2Mbps = 6ms

To count the total transmission time needed, 4.5 times of the time_one is needed.

Thus, to transmit four packets, the total delay time is **4.5 * time_one = 4.5 * 6ms = 27ms**

For the second general case, the delay time is **[(n+1) * L - x]/R**.
