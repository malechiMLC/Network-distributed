## P40  

(a) The intervals of slow start: 1-6 and 23-26.  

(b) The intervals of congestion avoidance: 7-16 and 17-22.  

(c) The segment loss is detected by a triple duplicate ACK.  

(d) The segment loss is detected by a timeout.  

(e) The initial value of `ssthresh` at the first transmission round is 32.  

(f) 42 / 2 = 21  

(g) 29 / 2 = 14.5, that is 14.  

(h) The 70th segment is sent during the 7th transmission round.  

(i) ssthresh = 8 / 2 = 4,  cwnd = ssthresh + 3MSS = 4 + 3 = 7  

(j) In the 16th round, ssthresh = cwnd / 2 = 21, cwnd is 1.  
    So at the 19th round: `ssthresh = 21`, `cwnd = 4`.  
    
(k) 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 21 = 52 packets  

## P44  

(a) Since `cwnd` increases 1 MSS, so it take 6 RTT for cwnd.  

(b) S = 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 51 MSS, thus, the average throughput is 51/6 = 8.5 MSS/RTT.  

## P46  

(a) Suppose the max-window size is W, then W * 1500 * 8 / 0.15 = 10 * 10^6  
Thus, W = 125  

(b) The average window size is,( 0.5 * W + W) / 2 = 0.75 * W = 94  

The average throughput = 94 * 1500 * 8 / 0.15 = 7.52 Mbps  

(c) The window size will change to W / 2 = 125 / 2 = 62, when a packet loss occurs.  

Thus, we need ( 125 - 62 ) * 0.15 = 9.45s.
