## P40  

(a) The intervals of slow start: 1~6 and 23~26.  

(b) The intervals of congestion avoidance: 7-16 and 17-22.  

(c) The segment loss is detected by a triple duplicate ACK.  

(d) The segment loss is detected by a timeout.  

(e) The initial value of `ssthresh` at the first transmission round is 32.  

(f) 42 / 2 = 21  

(g) 29 / 2 = 14.5, that is 14.  

(h) The 70th segment is sent during the 7th transmission round.  

(i) ssthresh = 8 / 2 = 4,  cwnd = ssthresh + 3MSS = 4 + 3 = 7  

(j) In the 16th round, ssthresh = cwnd / 2 = 21, cwnd is 1.  
    So at the 19th round: ssthresh = 21, cwnd = 4.  
    
(k) 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 21 = 52 packets
