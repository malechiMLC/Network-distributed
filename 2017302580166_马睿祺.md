Server sends files to each client in parallel, the speed is **us/N<=dmin**  
Thus, the client also drops at this rate, the time needed is ""F/(us/N)=FN/us**  

Since us/N>=dmin, server downloads at **dmin** rate, thus, the receiving time is **F/dmin**.  

Since **NF/dmin>=F/dmin**.  
Thus, **time=NF/us=max{NF/us, F/dmin}**
