### P23  
a. Server sends files to each client in parallel, the speed is **us/N<=dmin**  
Thus, the client also drops at this rate, the time needed is ""F/(us/N)=FN/us**  

b. Since us/N>=dmin, server downloads at **dmin** rate, thus, the receiving time is **F/dmin**.  

c. Since **NF/dmin>=F/dmin**.  
Thus, **time=NF/us=max{NF/us, F/dmin}**  

### P27  
a. Since we can choose the version of video and audio freely, you need to save a total of **n*n=n^2** files.  
b. Because the stream is sent, there is no need to generate mixed files in advance, so a total of **N+n=2n** files need to be stored.  


### P28  
a. If we run TCPClient before running TCPServer, TCPClient will attempt to connect to a server that does not exist, and the connection will fail.  
b. If you run UDPClient before running UDPServer, UDPClient will run successfully and data transfer will not be affected. Because there is no handshake between UDPClient and UDPServer before sending data.  
c. If the client and server use different port numbers, the connection between the client and the server will fail.
