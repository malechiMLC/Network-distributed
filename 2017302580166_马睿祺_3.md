## P3  
In addition to HTTP, there are DNS protocols in the application layer, UDP (transport layer protocol of DNS) and TCP (transport layer protocol of HTTP) in the transport layer

## P31  
**Adventage：** 
Reliable transmission: judge packet loss.   
The error code depends on the segment number and confirmation number of TCP. In order to ensure the reliability of message transmission, TCP gives each packet a serial number, and the serial number also ensures the orderly reception of packets sent to the receiving entity. Then the receiving entity sends back a corresponding ack to the bytes that have been successfully received. If the sending entity does not receive the ACK within a reasonable round-trip delay (RTT), the corresponding data (assuming it is lost) will be retransmitted.  

**Disadventage：**
Only unicast transmission is supported: each TCP transmission connection can only have two endpoints, only point-to-point data transmission, and multicast and broadcast transmission modes are not supported.
